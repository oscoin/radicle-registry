//! PoW algorithm implementation based on Blake3 hashing
//!
//! The difficulty is an average number of hashes that need to be checked in order mine a block.
//! It's capped at `2^192 - 1`. This limit guarantees that Substrate can calculate a sum
//! of difficulties of blocks in a chain of up to `2^64` height and not overflow. This cap
//! should never affect the difficulty with current technology due to constraints of the universe.
//!
//! In order to check if the data hash passes the difficulty test, it must be interpreted as
//! a big-endian 256-bit number. If it's smaller than or equal to the threshold, it passes.
//! The threshold is calculated from difficulty as `U256::max_value / difficulty`.
//!
//! There's no difficulty adjustment algorithm yet.
