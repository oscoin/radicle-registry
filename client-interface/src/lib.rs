//! Provide an abstract trait for registry clients and the necessary types.
//!
//! The [Client] trait defines one method for each transaction of the registry ledger as well as
//! methods to get the ledger state.
//!
//! [radicle_registry_client_interface] provides a [Client] implementation that talks to a running node.
//! [radicle_registry_memory_client] provides an implementation that runs the ledger in memory and
//! can be used for testing.
