Prerequisites
-------------

Follow the [README's Prerequisites guide](README.md#prerequisites).


Running development node
------------------------

~~~
./scripts/build-dev-node
./scripts/run-dev-node
~~~

The build script purges the chain data before running to avoid consensus issues.

To purge the chain state manually run

~~~
./scripts/run-dev-node purge-chain
~~~

The dev node runs the `dev` chain and uses `./runtime/latest.wasm` as
the genesis runtime.

Packages
--------

* `runtime` contains the Substrate runtime code that defines the ledger and
  lives on chain.
* `runtime-tests` contains a comprehensive test suite for the runtime code that
  uses the client.
* `node` contains the node code which includes the runtime code.
* `client` contains the high-level client library for interacting with the
  registry through a node and an emulator implementation.
* `cli` contains a binary for interacting with the registry node to submit
  transactions and read state.
* `core` contains basic types used throughout the Radicle Registry.
  If e.g. a trait or a datatype is used by more than one of the above packages,
  it should probably go into `core`. See `./core/README.md` for details.


Running checks and tests
------------------------

We check our code with clippy and `cargo fmt`
```
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D clippy::all
cargo fmt --workspace -- --check
```

To check the Wasm build of the runtime run
```
cargo clippy \
  --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml \
  --no-default-features \
  --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  -- -D clippy::all
```

You can run all tests with `cargo test --workspace --all-targets`. For the
end-to-end tests you need to [build and run a dev
node](#running-development-node)

Black-box tests for the runtime logic are implemented with the client emulator
in `runtime/tests/main.rs`.

End-to-end tests that run against a real node are implemented in
`client/tests/end_to_end.rs`.

To run specific tests sequentially as opposed to the parallel default,
we use the [serial-test](https://crates.io/crates/serial_test) crate, simply
having to mark the targeted tests with `#[serial]`.

Continuous Deployment
---------------------

We’re continuously deploying master builds of the node to the devnet. We’re
using Kubernetes for this. You can find the code in `ci/deploy`.


Make a release
--------------

To create a release from the current master branch run `./scripts/create-release`.

### Tags

Our tags are composed of the release date followed by a number representing the
number of releases done in that same date. For example, `2020-04-09-0` would
be the first release done that day. Should we need to make a new release in
that same day, it'd be tagged `2020-04-09-1`.


Local devnet
------------

We provide a `docker-compose` file to run a local devnet. See
`./local-devnet/README.md` for more information.


Updating substrate
------------------

To update the revision of substrate run
~~~
./scripts/update-substrate <revision>
~~~
where `<revision>` is the new Git revision SHA.

Runtime updates
---------------

There are special policies and processes around updates to the `runtime` package.

Updates to the runtime are tracked by the `VERSION` exported from the `runtime`
crate. The updates fall into two categories: Implementation updates and
semantic updates.

### Implementation updates

Implementation updates only change the implementation of the runtime but do not
affect the semantics.

Commits with implementation updates must increment the `impl_version` field of
`VERSION`. They may not recompile `./runtime/latest.wasm`.

### Semantic updates

Semantic changes must increment the `spec_version` field and reset the
`impl_version` field to `0`.

In a commit with a semantic update you must also update the latest Wasm
runtime.

```
./scripts/build-runtime-wasm ./runtime/latest.wasm
```

For semantic updates to take effect on an existing chain they need to be
deployed to the chain.

```
radicle-registry-cli runtime update ./runtime/latest.wasm --author <sudo_key>
```

The author key must be the sudo key configured in the chain specification for
the chain that is updated.

For the runtime update transaction to be accepted the `spec_version` of the
submitted runtime must be greater than the `spec_version` of the on-chain
runtime.

Changes to the chain state must be backwards-compatibility. See the “Versioning”
section in `core/README.md` for details.

Updating Continuous Integration's base Docker image
---------------------------------------------------

1. In `.buildkite/pipeline.yaml`, in value of `.test` -> `env` -> `DOCKER_IMAGE` replace image tag (last part after `:`) with a nonexistent tag (e.g. `does_not_exist`).

Example:
```
DOCKER_IMAGE: gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-registry/ci-base:0d7ce69abca7dfe7dcbf26e319645405f31f4901
```
to
```
DOCKER_IMAGE: gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-registry/ci-base:does_not_exist
```

2. Push the commit to the repository and let the build agent finish all the work for this commit. **Make sure that this commit is preserved!** Do not amend, squash, rebase or delete it, it should be merged unmodified into master. This way it will be easy to look up the state of the project used by the build agent.

**What happens on the build agent:** no docker image can be found for the given tag. The agent will run the full pipeline and save the docker image under a tag same as the current commit ID.

3. Copy the current commit ID and set it as the previously edited image tag.

Example:
```
DOCKER_IMAGE: gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-registry/ci-base:does_not_exist
```
to
```
DOCKER_IMAGE: gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-registry/ci-base:e8c699d4827ed893d8dcdab6e72de40732ad5f3c
```

**What happens on the build agent:** when any commit with this change is pushed, the build agent will find the image under the configured tag. It will reuse it instead of rebuilding and save time.
