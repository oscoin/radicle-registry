Prerequisites
---------------

ⓘ Follow this guide to get started [developing](./DEVELOPING.md)
   or to [build from source](#build-from-source).

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

   It will run `rustup`, The Rust toolchain installer, which installs
   `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`, amongst other standard tools that compose
   the default Rust toolchain.

2. Run `rustc --version` in a new shell.

   To verify that the installion is sound.

3. Run `./scripts/rustup-setup`

   To install all `rustup` components and targets required by the
   Radicle Registry.


Build from source
-----------------

⚠ Make sure you have followed the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) guide
  before proceeding.

We currently only provide prebuilt binaries for `x86_64` linux targets in
the [Radicle Registry Releases][releases-page] page.

To build the Radicle Registry binaries to run on other targers, run:

``` bash
./scripts/build-release
```

The resulting binaries can be found at:

* `./target/release/radicle-registry-cli`
* `./target/release/radicle-registry-node`

[releases-page]: https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-registry/releases


Getting the Node
----------------

We build binaries of the node and docker images for every pushed commit.

You can obtain the node binaries from “Artifacts” section of a build on
[Buildkite][buildkite]. Node binaries are available for the
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target triple.

You can pull a docker image of the node with
```bash
docker pull gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-registry/node:<commit-sha>
```
In the image the node binary is located at `/usr/local/bin/radicle-registry-node`

To build the node from source see [`DEVELOPING.md`][dev-manual].

[buildkite]: https://buildkite.com/monadic/radicle-registry/


Running the node
----------------

To run a node you need to specify the chain
~~~
radicle-registry-node --chain devnet
~~~

See below for more information on the different chains.

For more information use the `--help` flag. See also [“Running development
node”][dev-mode].

[dev-mode]: ./DEVELOPING.md#running-development-node

### Logging

The node prints logs to stdout in the following format

~~~
<local time> <level> <target> <msg>
~~~

You can adjust the global log level and the log level for specific targets with
the [`RUST_LOG` environment variable][rust-log-docs].

[rust-log-docs]: https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/#enabling-logging

Chains
------

The chain a node follows is set by the `--chain` flag. The following chains are
supported.

### `ffnet`

The `ffnet` is our first public network for friends & family to participate.

### `dev`

The `dev` chain is intended for local development. The node runs an isolated
network with a dummy proof-of-work. The `dev` chain uses `./runtime/latest.wasm`
as the genesis runtime.

### `devnet`

We host a devnet that you can connect to. To join you need to use the most
recent pre-built binary (see “Getting the node”).

Like the `dev` chain, we use `./runtime/latest.wasm` as the genesis runtime.

We are frequently resetting the devnet blockchain. If you local node is not
syncing blocks download the most recent version and run `radicle-registry-node
--chain devnet purge-chain`.


Using the Client
----------------

The client for the registry node is provided by the `radicle-registry-client`
package in the `./client` directory. To get started take a look at
`./client/examples/getting_started.rs`.

You’ll need to build the client with Rust Nightly.

To build and view the client documentation run `./scripts/build-client-docs
--open`.

You can find examples in the `./client/examples` directory.


Account Keys
------------

We use Ed25519 keys for accounts. Key creation and handling functionality is
provided by the `radicle-registry-client::ed25519` module. To use this module
you will likely need to import the `radicle-registry-client::CryptoPair` and
`radicle-registry-client::CryptoPublic` traits.

You can create key pairs using [`CryptoPair::generate()`][api-pair-generate]
```rust
use radicle-registry-client::{ed25519, CryptoPair};
let (key, seed) = ed25519::Pair::generate();
```

To create keys from human readable strings, use [`CryptoPair::from_string`][api-pair-from-string].
```rust
use radicle-registry-client::{ed25519, CryptoPair};
let alice = ed25519::Pair::from_string("//Alice", None);
```

To obtain the [`SS58`][ss58-docs] address for your local key-pairs, you can run:

``` bash
cargo run -p radicle-registry-cli -- key-pair list
```

The `radicle-registry-client::ed25519` module and the crypto traits are
re-exports from [`substrate_primitives::ed25519`][api-ed25519] and
[`substrate_primitives::crypto`][api-crypto], respectively

Developing with the Client
--------------------------

For development you can create a ledger emulator with
`radicle_registry_client::Client::new_emulator()`. Instead of connecting to a
node this client runs the ledger in memory. See the API docs for more
information.


Using the CLI
-------------

We provide a CLI to talk read and update the ledger in the `cli` directory. To
learn more run `cargo run -p radicle-registry-cli -- --help`.
